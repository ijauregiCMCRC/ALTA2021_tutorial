## Introduction

This is the code used in the tutorial at the
[19th Annual Workshop of the Australasian Language Technology 
Association (ALTA 2021)](https://alta2021.alta.asn.au/).
You can find the slides of the presentation here(link needs to be 
insterted). 

In this code repository we show how to train neural machine translation
and abstractive summarisation models using [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/), a 
framework meant to remove the "boilerplate" from the development of 
research models.

## Getting Started

- Can run this on jupyter notebooks, or in google-colab.

### Translation

Check the translation folder to start with this section of the tutorial.

### Summarisation

Check the summarisation folder to start with this section of the tutorial.
