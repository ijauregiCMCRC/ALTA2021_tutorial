## Introduction

This tutorial addresses neural machine translation (NMT) and summarisation 
by deep learning approaches*. We will first provide a general introduction 
covering baseline models, training, inference and evaluation. We will then 
review some of the contemporary approaches, including reinforcement 
learning-based, transfer learning-based, unsupervised, and a few more. 
The rest of the tutorial will present code in PyTorch Lightning, a framework 
meant to remove the "boilerplate" from the development of research models. 
The speakers are IÃ±igo Jauregi Unanue, Jacob Parnell and Massimo Piccardi 
from UTS and RoZetta Technology.
